# Computational Station
This is the repository for the educational part of a [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov) proposal. 

## Objectives of This Educational Part
1. The objective is to create a **cost-effective and portable computer cluster** using [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) and the [OpenHPC](https://openhpc.community) stack.
2. A portable computer cluster will **empower students to perform simple simulations** in the area of computational chemistry and computational materials science.
3. To **facilitate access to computational chemistry and computational materials science**, we provide a **blueprint** of a **cost-effective and portable computer cluster** that can be built by schools and individuals.
